summary: The rosbot-xl teleop snap
description: |
  The rosbot-xl teleop snap allows for teleoperating the robot
  from either the keyboard, gamepad or leave it to the navigation stack.

  The snap offers the possibility to teleoperate the robot from a joystick,

    rosbot-xl-teleop.joy

  This app launches both the gamepad driver as well as the joy teleop node.

  The robot can also be teleoperated from a keyboard (e.g. SSH) with,

    rosbot-xl-teleop.key

  The snap makes use of a topic multiplexer to switch from one source to another.
  Its input topic can be selected as,

    rosbot-xl-teleop.mux-select <topic>

  Note that when launching the joy or key app,
  the appropriate topic is automatically selected.
